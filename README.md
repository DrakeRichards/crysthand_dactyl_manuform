# Crystalhand's Dactyl (Edited By DrakeRichards)

I liked the modifications that crystalhand made to the manuform, but the default settings in his version felt uncomfortable to me. 



## Changes Made

- Decreased x-axis tilt.
- Moved the thumb cluster out a bit to fit longer thumbs.
- Adjusted the TRRS holder to use a panel-mounted one.
- Adjusted the USB holder to use the more common Adafruit models.

## Notes

All screws used are m3x12 for the dactyl.  
Brass knurled nuts m3x5x5 are used for to attatch the dactyl top and bottom case and the Manuform top and bottom cover.

TRRS jack being used is SJ1-43502PM. USB holder is Adafruit "PANEL MOUNT CABLE USB C TO MICRO".
